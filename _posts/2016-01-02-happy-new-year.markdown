So I just started using Ghost. Is there some sort of ghost club I am now welcomed into? 
### What about Images?

Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:

![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)

Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:

![A bowl of bananas]


### Quoting

Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!

### Working with Code

Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.

    .awesome-thing {
        display: block;
        width: 100%;
    }

### Ready for a Break? 

Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.

### Advanced Usage

There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.

<input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" />

That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)
